				We are a QPOC artist collective based in New Haven CT, working on new infrastructures for mental health and art. We were recently awarded $32,000 from The Community Foundation for Greater New Haven, with the Arts Council of Greater New Haven as a fiscal sponsor. This has allowed us to make new plans throughout 2022 and 2023!
				<br><br>One of these plans is a mutual aid fund to help other artists get through unjust and difficult situations. We are working within the context of late-stage capitalism and a multi-year pandemic whose full effects may only be seen years or generations later. We are motivated by a need to prepare and live at the same time.
				<br><br>For too long, artists have had to depend on an outdated infrastructure for support & resources. Access to this system is limited by the racism, sexism, classism, & homophobia it was born in. So we are building something new.
				<br><br>We started utilizing our mutual aid fund at the end of 2021, and we created the love broadcast to replenish & build the fund for this year. You can venmo @jisu_ or cashapp $jisusheen to contribute. 100% of all donations will go to mutual aid!
